# 5. System Deployment

## Objective
This phase focuses on preparing and executing the system deployment. Key activities include creating deployment packages and guidelines, 
reviewing them for quality, submitting them to the Deployment Center, and coordinating with the Deployment Center to complete the deployment process. 
The phase concludes with setting the baseline for future iterations and finalizing the deployment.

## Key Activities
- Start: Begin the deployment process.
- Prepare Deployment Package and Guidelines: Simultaneously create the deployment package and provide clear deployment instructions.
- Review: Evaluate the deployment package and guidelines to ensure they meet the required standards.
- Submit to Deployment Center: Send the reviewed package and guidelines to the Deployment Center.
- Coordinate with the Deployment Center for operations: Work with the Deployment Center to carry out the deployment process.
- Base Line: Approve the deployment as the baseline for future iterations.
- End: Conclude this phase after successful deployment and approval.
